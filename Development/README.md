**NA28VerseTrees/** - folder with trees for NA28 that are verse-based. Referred to when removing undesired artifacts in UGNT trees from splitting sentence-based to be verse-based trees, as well as manually editing the UGNT trees to fit the UGNT text and morphology.

**UGNT_Released/** - folder with UGNT trees that were created in the release format.

**UGNT_Research/** - folder with UGNT trees that have more information in the nodes than in the release trees for research purposes (not for release).
