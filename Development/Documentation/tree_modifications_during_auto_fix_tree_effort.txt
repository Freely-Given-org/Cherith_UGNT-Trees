These record manual changes to the trees that were a result of trying to do auto fixing of the trees.
Where there is clearly an initial bad tree (maybe from previous auto or manual correction) before auto fixing, I will manually fix it.
If there are lots of the same problem, we will fix auto correct it.
Where the problem is because of a change in morphology, even if there is only a few, we will auto correct it.

	Comment: Error occured at the end of the verse for a whole section that is new in UGNT and I created by hand.
	Modifications:	Changed ἀπολελυμένην -> verb -> vp [->] ADV to ἀπολελυμένην -> verb -> vp [-> V -> CL ->] ADV

41004020
	Comment: Had changed the other two instances of {S O -> CL} changing to {pp -> ADV} but didn't do that for the third instances of pp, so ended up with incorrect {pp -> CL}
	Modifications:	Changed pp -> [CL} to pp -> ADV

42020042
	Comment: I added a new det from UGNT and attached it as {det noun -> np} forgetting that the grammar requires {det np -> np}
	Modifications:	Changed noun [->] np(0) to noun [-> np(1) ->] np(0) where {det np(1) -> np(0)}

43013018
	Comment: A UGNT word was added and I incorrectly added it as [prep -> ADV] rather than [prep -> adv -> advp -> ADV]
	Modifications:	Changed 430130180171 μετ’ "after" -> prep [->] ADV to  μετ’ "after" -> prep [-> adv -> advp ->] ADV

43018016
	Comment: I had previously manually added a verb so it was {verb -> VC} but it should be {verb -> vp -> VC}
	Modifications:	Changed verb [->] VC] to verb [-> vp ->] VC
	Modifications:	vp Rule "V2VP", Head "0"
	Modifications:	VC Rule "vp2VC", Head "0"
	Modifications:	CL Rule "S-VC-P", Head "1"

44019008
	Comment: A det is not in UGNT and I incorrectly just made the pp -> O, but there is no such rule.
	Modifications:	Deleted 440190080131 περὶ "about" -> prep [-> pp ->] O, connected O to np where {prep np -> pp}
	Modifications:	Created [adv -> advp -> ADV], connected adv to prep, and CL to ADV, where {V O -> CL}

	Comment: There was [CL P -> O] which is clearly wrong. 
	Comment: The original NA28 tree had {S VC P -> CL - P} so we will change it back to that
	Modifications:	Deleted "..." --> P [->] O, connected CL to P where {CL P -> O}

45008011
	Modifications:	Deleted 450080110181 Χριστὸν "Christ" -> noun -> np(0) [->] O
	Modifications:	Connected np(1) to np(0) where 450080110191 Ἰησοῦν "Jesus" -> noun -> np -> np(1) -> O

51002023
	Comment: There was a deletion of a conj, and I originally just deleted the conj, thus changing {np conj np conj np -> np} to {np conj np np -> np}
	Comment: But there is no {np conj np np -> np} rule. I thought about adding the rule, but I later think the two np's are possibly Np-Appos {np* np -> np}
	Modifications:	Deleted  510020230101 ταπεινοφροσύνῃ, "humility" -> noun -> np(0) [->] np(1)
	Modifications:	Deleted "severe treatment of (the) body" --> np(2) [->] np(1)
	Modifications:	Created [np(3)], Rule "Np-Appos", connected to np(0) and np(2)
	Modifications:	Connected np(1) to np(3)
	Modifications:	Changed np(1) Rule to "NpaNp"
	Q: Is this correct?
	Comment: CHECK TREE
