	Comment: UnicodeLemma = "ὄφελον" -> ptcl -> conj, conj CL -> CL
	Comment: Not able to match correct UnicodeLemma for conj to disambiguate between three rules
	Comment: NA28 it is verb -> vp -> V -> CL
	Comment: not sure how it got this way. It must have been due to a previous auto correction.
	Comment: Can solve by by making it {ptcl CL -> CL} since there is only one rules for this
	Modifications:	Changed "ὄφελον" -> ptcl [-> conj ->] CL to "ὄφελον" -> ptcl [->] CL

	Comment: 440020200121 UnicodeLemma = ἤ -> conj (Type="Coordinating"), conj CL -> CL
	Comment: Not able to match correct UnicodeLemma for conj to disambiguate between three rules
	Comment: Is a new word in UGNT for this verse
	Comment: Can solve by moving it before 440020200111 πρὶν -> conj, and attach it to the CL -> Verse so it coordinates higher CL's
	Comment: However, biblehub specifically states that in Acts2:20, "πρὶν ἤ" is "before that", "before"
	Comment: But we
	Modifications:	Deleted ἤ -> conj (Type="Coordinating") [-> CL ->] CL(0), connected CL(0) to CL(1) where {conj CL(1) -> CL}
	Modifications:	Connected CL(2) to conj, where CL(2) -> Verse
	Modifications:	Changed ἤ -> conj English to "than"
