This file is based upon Errors.CheckTreesAgainstMorphData-2022.07.15-modifications-edited.txt where the trees were modified based upon 
differences found between the terminal nodes in the tree and the data in ugnt-morphs.tsv

However, later on, I Andi let me know that even though there are no "num" lexical part-of-speech in the UGNT morphology,
he wanted to keep the "num" and "nump" nodes in the tree as the original were regardless of whether the words changed to 
"det" or other categories. He felt the best solution was to change something like det -> nump to det -> num -> nump.
So in essense we would add lexical rules that changed a lexical category back to num, but we still want the UGNT
category to be in the terminal notes of the trees.


RECORD OF UNIFIXING MADE TO KEEP NUM AND NUMP NODES

Grammar:
	Add {det* -> num} rule

	Modifications:	Changed δύο, -> det [->] np to δύο, -> det [-> num -> nump] -> np
44001015
	Comment: This was already changed in previous unfixes
44004022
	Modifications:	Changed τεσσεράκοντα -> det [->] np [->] adjp to τεσσεράκοντα -> det [-> num -> nump] -> np [-> advp ->] adjp
	Comment: Also added back the advp that is there in the NA28 tree
44023013
	Modifications:	Changed τεσσεράκοντα -> det [->] np to τεσσεράκοντα -> det [-> num -> nump] -> np
	Comment: Did not add back the advp that is there in the NA28 tree because the previous word was changed from adj to noun
44023021
	Modifications:	Changed τεσσεράκοντα, -> det [->] np [-> np(0)] -> np to τεσσεράκοντα, -> det [-> num -> nump ->] np [-> advp -> adjp(0)] -> np
	Comment: Also added back the advp and parent adjp that was there is the way it is in the NA28 tree
44025006
	Modifications:	Changed ὀκτὼ -> det [-> np -> np(0) ->] np(1) to ὀκτὼ -> det [-> num -> nump -> nump(0) -> np ->] np(1)

	Comment: The parent of conjoined nodes is nump in the NA28 tree
	Comment: Did not add an advp node since the previous word was changed from adjp to noun (as in 44023013)
