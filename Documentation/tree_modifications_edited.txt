PROCEDURE

1. Combined the data in diff.tsv, addition.tsv, deletion.tsv, and substitution.tsv into a new file that lists the changes for each verse in diff.tsv
2. Used Beyond Compare to do a diff of NA28.normalized.text.txt with ugnt.normalized.text.txt to see the actually differences for each of the verses in diff.tsv.
	This was needed because some of the automatic identifications of differences in addition.tsv, deletion.tsv, and substitution.tsv were not always correct, sometimes leaving out changes, identifying the wrong instance of a word that is changed, or sometimes having a very complicated change list for a simple change.
3. Used ugnt.normalized.tsv, ugnt-morphs.tsv to determine how to create added words.
4. I used the NA28 trees in the folder NA28VerseTrees as a reference.
5. I used the trees in UGNTVerseTrees as the starting point for making changes. These trees are different from the NA28 trees in the following ways:
	a. morphIds for the most part have been updated (except words to be deleted, and sometimes for substitutions)
	b. The Unicode, Lemma, StrongNumber for substitutions (morphId was not updated for substitutions).
	c. The Unicode, Lemma, StrongNumber, and morophId for the UGNT words that could be matched to NA28 words.
4. I would first compare what I see in Beyond Compare to the addtions, deletions, and substitutions to see if they were correct, documenting any corrections to the diff analysis.
5. On occasion (I did not always do this step), I would check the words that had slight Unicode differences but not flagged as different to see if there were changes in category, case, tense, mood, person, number, etc.
6. If there was potentially more than one "good" analysis, I would document that, chose one, and make changes to the tree based upon the one I chose.
7. If there were some changes that required tree structures I had not seen before, I would check the existing grammar in greekgrammarNA28122319.cs (Randall said this was the one used to create the NA28 trees).
8. If I had questions, I marked a verse with "Q:" followed by my question.
9. If I wanted to record comments, I marked a verse with "Comment:" followed by my comment.
10. Marked a verse with "Comment: CHECK TREE" for all verses that I felt should be checked by someone with a better understanding of Greek and/or the grammar.
11. Marked a verse with "ERROR:" if I think there may be an ERROR in the UGNT data
12. For substitutions, often the starting tree would already have it updated correctly, but not always. So I documented what was changed regardless of whether it was automatic or I had to do it manually.

ISSUES

1. Some words do not have different Unicode text, or may just have slight differences that were determined to not be significant (i.e. wasn't analyzed as a different Strong's Number),
	and so were not identified as different. However, some of these have a different category under UGNT, which impacts the tree. I did not always correct these since I think they can be automatically corrected later.
		a. Numbers changed from num in NA28 to det in UGNT. Some consequences of these changes were automatically corrected, but others were not fully corrected.
		b. Some instances of conj, intj, adv are different between NA28 and UGNT.
		c. 
2. It was not always clear to me whether to combine np's by conjoining them or creating a left/right branching structure.
3. There were places that it seems two vp's had the same S, but the grammar doesn't have a way to clearly express this (usually saw two conjoined CL's with the second one not having an S)
4. SubRef needs to be corrected in verses where the location of the referred to subject has changed (i.e., its morphId has changed).


NOTATION

1. To indicate a tree fragment that is a path from a terminal node up the tree through parent nodes:
	a. "->" indicate a branch going up the tree in order to be consistent with the notation in the grammar file (i.e., it is a constituents to parent contraction rule, not an expansion rule).
	b. square brackets enclose the fragment being referred to
2. To indicate a subtree of constituents and parent, curly brackes are used to enclose the notation.
3. To indicate a subtree that is more complex:
	a. double quotes are used to indicate a surface Unicode string
	b. "-->" is to indicates smallest subtree that includes the surface Unicode string on the left that leads to the category on the right that spans the whole string (possibly spans more).
4. If a node is referred to more than once, and more than one node with the same category is referred to, the one referred to more than once will be indexed with "Cat(#)" where "Cat" is the category of the node, and "#" is a unique digit

	Comment: CHECK TREE
	

40008009
	Addition:	400080090081	τασσόμενος	"appoint" -> verb
	Modifications:	created [τασσόμενος -> verb -> vp -> vp(1)], inserted vp(1) between V and vp(2) where "ἔχων" --> vp(2)
40008013
	Deletion:	400080130161	αὐτοῦ
	Modifications:	deleted [αὐτοῦ -> pron -> np(0) -> np(1) ->] np(2), connected np(2) to np(3) where {np(3) np(0) -> np(1)}
40008021
	Deletion:	400080210051	αὐτοῦ
	Modifications:	deleted [αὐτοῦ -> pron -> np(0) -> np(1) ->] np(2), connected np(2) to np(3) where {np(3) np(0) -> np(1)}

40009004
	Addition:	400090040101	τί	
	Substitution:	400090040091	400090040091	ἱνατί	ἵνα
	NEW ANALYSIS: It is more like "ἱνατί" being split up into "ἵνα" and "τί" where "τί" takes the place in the tree of "ἱνατί"
	Addition:	400090040091	ἵνα	"-" -> conj (subordinating)
	Substitution:	400090040091	400090040101	ἱνατί	τί	"why" -> pron
	Modifications:	created [ἵνα -> conj -> CL(0)], inserted CL(0) between CL(1) and CL(2) where CL2 spans the rest of the verse
	Modifications:	changed [ἱνατί -> adv -> advp] -> ADV to [τί -> pron -> np] -> ADV
	Comment: It seems ἵνα and what comes after it should be a clause that is sister to the previous verb "said" rather than a conjoined clause
	Comment: It seems ἵνα serves as a complementizer "said (that) "how are you thinking evil in your hearts?"
	Comment: Not sure if "τί" --> ADV is correct.
	Comment: CHECK TREE
40009018
	Substitution:	400090180081	400090180081	ἐλθὼν	προσελθὼν	"coming" -> verb
	Modifications:	changed ἐλθὼν -> verb Unicode "προσελθὼν", Lemma to "προσέρχομαι", StrongNumber to 4334
	Q: Why is the morphId 40009018008 in both the original and modified tree? I think it should be 40090180081
	A: Original NA28 trees all had only 11 digits for morphId, and the program that automatically updated morphId to 12 digits but didn't do it for substitutions (only deletions and unchanged words to fix morphIds)


40010032
	Deletion:	400100320201	τοῖς
	Modifications:	deleted [τοῖς -> det -> np(0) ->] pp, connected pp to np(1) where {det np(1) -> np(0)}
40010033
	Deletion:	400100330181	τοῖς
	Modifications:	deleted [τοῖς -> det -> np(0) ->] pp, connected pp to np(1) where {det np(1) -> np(0)}
40010042
	Substitution:	400100420031	400100420031	ἂν	ἐὰν	"*" -> ptcl
	Modifications:	changed ἂν -> ptcl Unicode to ἐὰν, Lemma to "ἐάν", StrongNumber to 1473, morphId to 400100420031
	Q: What is the difference between English being "*" and "-"? Is "*" indicating no possible English word while "-" is it is not necessary to have it glossed?
	Comment: Looks like the person changed the starting tree instead of the modified file.


40011009
	Addition:	400110090051	ἰδεῖν
	Deletion:	400110090041	ἰδεῖν
	Comment: Looks like "ἰδεῖν" --> V and "προφήτην" --> O switched order. But they are not sisters in the original NA28 tree. 
	Comment: In fact, the original NA28 tree seems strange since the second V and O are not sisters.
	Comment: The order of the verbs is also reversed in the original. 
	Comment: Given the UGNT has it split into two questions, I think the best revision is to make these two coordinated clauses.
	Comment: The first one is "Why did you go out?" and the second is "To see a prophet?"
	Modifications:	deleted ἰδεῖν? -> verb -> vp -> V(0) [->] CL(0)
	Modifications:	changed [τί -> pron -> np -> O -> CL ->] ADV to [τί -> pron -> np ->] ADV, English to "why"
	Modifications:	connected CL(1) to V(0) where "προφήτην" --> CL(1)
	Comment: CHECK TREE
40011019
	Substitution:	400110190261	400110190261	ἔργων	τέκνων	"children" -> noun
	Modifications:	changed ἔργων -> noun Unicode to τέκνων, Lemma to τέκνον, StrongNumber to 5043


40012015
	Deletion:	400120150101	ὄχλοι	
	Modifications:	deleted [ὄχλοι -> noun -> np(0) -> np(1) ->] S, connected S to adjp where {np(0) adjp -> np(1)}
	Comment: The word πολλοί 400120150111 also changed from adj to a pron (masculine)
	Modifications:	changed πολλοί -> [adj -> adjp] -> S to [pron -> np], Gender to Masculine


40013004
	Addition:	400130040161	καὶ	"and" -> conj
	Comment: The addition of the conj requires changing the tree to be a conjoining of two CL's, the first being "the birds having come" and the second "devoured them"
	Modifications: deleted ἦλθεν -> verb -> vp -> V -> CL(1) [-> ADV ->] CL(2), connected CL(2) to CL(1)
	Modifications: disconnected CL(2) from S(0), V(0) and O(0), connected CL(1) to S(0)
	Modifications: created CL(3), connected CL(3) to V(0) and O(0), connected CL(2) to CL(3)
	Modifications: created [καὶ	-> conj ->] CL(2)
	Comment: 400130040131 ἐλθόντα changed to ἦλθεν so mood changed from participle to indicative
	Modifications: changed ἦλθεν -> verb English to "came"
40013007
	Substitution:	400130070121	400130070121	ἔπνιξαν	ἀπέπνιξαν	"choked" -> verb
	Modifications:	changed ἔπνιξαν -> verb Unicode to "ἀπέπνιξαν", Lemma to "ἀποπνίγω", StrongNumber to 638
	Q: Again the substitution seems to be reversed. The tree in UGNTVerseTrees has ἀπέπνιξαν with the morphId 400130070121 while the tree in UGNT-Trees has ἔπνιξαν with the morphId 40013007012
	A: The substitution was done automatically to the original but was not copied to the modified version. It seems the person didn't start with the trees in UGNTVerseTrees.
40013022
	Addition:	400130220181	τούτου	"this" -> det
	Modifications:	created [τούτου -> det -> np(0)], inserted np(0) between np(1) and np(2) where "αἰῶνος" --> np(2)
	Modifications:	changed τοῦ 400130220161 -> det English from "of the" to "of"
40013030
	Substitution:	400130300041	400130300041	ἕως	μέχρι	"until" -> adv
	Modifications:	changed [ἕως -> prep -> pp] -> ADV to [μέχρι -> adv -> advp], Lemma to "μέχρι", StrongNumber to 3360
	Comment: There is a {adv np -> advp} rule


40014004
	Addition:	400140040041	ὁ
	Addition:	400140040051	Ἰωάννης
	Deletion:	400140040031	ὁ
	Deletion:	400140040041	Ἰωάννης
	Comment: It is more like "αὐτῷ" --> IO and "ὁ Ἰωάννης" --> S switch order
	Modifications:	switched order of "αὐτῷ" --> IO and "ὁ Ἰωάννης" --> S
	Modifications:	changed Ἰωάννης 0> noun Unicode to "Ἰωάννης,"
40014024
	Deletion:	400140240061	πολλοὺς
	Deletion:	400140240071	ἀπὸ
	Substitution:	400140240051	400140240051	σταδίους	μέσον	"middle" -> noun
	Substitution:	400140240091	400140240071	γῆς	θαλάσσης	"sea" -> noun
	Substitution:	400140240101	400140240081	ἀπεῖχεν	ἦν	"be" -> verb
	Comment: the diff analysis is incorrect
	Comment: It is more like deleting "σταδίους πολλοὺς" --> ADV, "ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς" --> ADV, and "ἀπεῖχεν" --> V
	Comment: and adding "μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης" --> P, and "ἦν" -> VC in its place
	Addition:	400140240051	μέσον	"middle" -> noun
	Addition:	400140240061	τῆς	"(of) the" -> det

40015002
	Deletion:	400150020161	αὐτῶν
	Modifications:	deleted [αὐτῶν -> pron -> np(0) -> np(1) ->] np(2), connected np(2) to np(3) where np(3) np(0) -> np(1)
40015004
	Addition:	400150040041	ἐνετείλατο	-> verb (command)
	Comment: Missing a substitution of "λέγων" for "εἶπεν"
	Substitution:	400150040041	400150040051	εἶπεν	λέγων	"said" -> verb
	Modifications:	created [ἐνετείλατο -> verb -> vp(0) -> vp(1)], inserted vp(1) between V and vp(2) where "λέγων" --> vp(2)
	Modifications:	changed εἶπεν -> verb Unicode to "λέγων", Lemma to "λέγω", StrongNumber to 3004
	Comment: Not sure if it is conjoining at the vp level, or whether the there should be two V's and each is the head of a CL and the CL's are conjoined
	Comment: CHECK TREE
40015014
	Addition:	400150140041	εἰσιν
	Deletion:	400150140031	τυφλοί
	Deletion:	400150140041	εἰσιν
	Comment: It looks more like "τυφλοί" --> adjp and "ὁδηγοὶ" swap places, also the deletion of "τυφλῶν"
	Deletion:	400150140061	τυφλῶν	
	Comment: But what complicates this in the tree is that εἰσιν is moved to before τυφλοί in the original, and so I think it should be also before ὁδηγοὶ in the new tree.
	Comment: There is also a comma after "τυφλὸς", which is the S of the following clause, but now it looks like it should be part of the P
	Comment: But δὲ is normally in the second position of the clause, so it seems "τυφλὸς" is still the S of the following clause.
	Modifications:	deleted [τυφλῶν -> adj -> adjp -> np ->] np(0)
	Modifications:	deleted τυφλοί -> adj -> adjp(0) [-> np ->] P, connected P to np(0), connected np(0) to adjp(0)

	Comment: CHECK TREE
40015032
	Substitution:	400150320221	400150320221	τί	τι	"someone, something" -> pron (indefinite)
	Modifications:	changed τί -> pron Unicode to "τι", Lemma to "τις", StrongNumber to 5100, English to "something"


40016021
	Addition:	400160210061	Χριστός
	Modifications:	created [Χριστός -> noun -> np -> np(0), inserted np(0) between np(1) and np(2) where "Ἰησοῦς" --> np(2)
	Modifications:	changed np(0)'s Type to Proper
	Comment: I looked at other places and "Jesus Christ" is an np-np compound and not a noun-noun compound.
	Comment: But I think this would have been better to handle as a noun-noun compound, or even make it one lexical proper noun rather than combining them in syntax.


40017009
	Substitution:	400170090241	400170090241	ἐγερθῇ	ἀναστῇ	"has been raised" -> verb

40017010
	Addition:	400170100061	αὐτοῦ	"of him" -> pron
	Modifications:	created [αὐτοῦ -> pron -> np -> np(0)], inserted np(0) between S and np(1) where "οἱ μαθηταὶ" --> np(1)
	Comments: Looking at 40002002, I see that the {det np -> np} is more basic and the {pron -> np} is an adjunt to the basic np.

40018007
	Addition:	400180070091	ἔστιν	"is" -> verb
	Modifications:	created [ἔστιν -> verb -> vp -> VC ->] CL
	Comment: The subject of ἔστιν is third person singular, but "σκάνδαλα" is plural so there seems to be a subject verb agreement mismatch.
	Comment: Or is because it is a CL subject, it is singular?

40018024
	Addition:	400180240071	αὐτῷ
	Deletion:	400180240061	αὐτῷ
	Comment: It seems more like switching the order of "αὐτῷ" --> IO and "εἷς" --> adjp
	Comment: But if we use the new word order, the tree would seem "strange" (IO is no longer sister to V), and so I think it is best to leave the tree as it is and have this as a case of changing the input order
	Modifications:	change αὐτῷ -> pron morphId to 400180240071 and εἷς -> noun morphId to 400180240061, leaving the tree as it was.

	Comment: In Jhn4:11,15,19,49, Luk5:12,7:6,9:54, Mat7:22,8:2 the address of "Lord" is not really S but a noun-> np -> CL that is conjoined to the following CL
	Modifications:	created [Κύριε -> noun -> np -> CL -> CL(0)], inserted CL(0) between CL(1) and CL(2) where CL(2) spans the rest of the verse

	Addition:	400180300121	οὗ	"he, who" -> pron (relative)
	Comment: Even though it is a relative pronoun, "who" doesn't seem to fit this situation as well as "he" for English.
	Modifications:	created [οὗ -> pron -> np -> S ->] CL where CL spans the rest of the verse, English to "he"

	Addition:	400210070131	αὐτῶν	"of them" -> pron (masculine)
	Comment: There are two potential problems with the modified tree. The "garments" are neuter but "them" is masculine, so there seems to be a gender mismatch.
	Comment: Also, there is a comma after "garments", which seems to indicate that the following "them" is not part of it.
	Comment: Could it be that "them" is the emphasis of the following clause, and conj should be moved before "them" in the tree (e.g. "and them, he sat on them")
	Comment: I think a compromise would be to simply attach "αὐτῶν" --> np higher up so it is the sister of "τὰ ἱμάτια" --> np rather than the usual place which is sister of "ἱμάτια".

	Deletion:	410020100111	ἀφιέναι
	Deletion:	410020100121	ἁμαρτίας
	Comment: It is more like switching the order of "ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας" --> ADV(0) and "ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς" --> ADV(1)
	Modifications:	switched order of "ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας" --> ADV(0) to after "ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς" --> ADV(1), resulting in {O V S ADV(1) ADV(0) -> CL}
	Modifications:	changed Unicode of noun to "ἁμαρτίας,", morphId to 410020100151
	Modifications:	changed morphId of verb "ἀφιέναι" to 410020100141

	Addition:	410030030091	ξηράν
	Deletion:	410030030071	ξηρὰν
	Comment: ξηρὰν changed from adj to noun, starting tree already has this fixed
	Comment: It is more like moving "ξηρὰν" -> np, after "χεῖρα ἔχοντι" but the later is not a separate consituent.
	Comment: Since the previous analysis has "τὴν ξηρὰν χεῖρα" as a single np constituent, I will keep this analysis, but it means the word order is not in sequence.
	Comment: I think a tree more faithful to the new word order would be something like "the one having the hand withered" where "withered" --> ADV
	Modifications:	switched order of "ξηρὰν" -> np(0) and "χεῖρα" -> np(1) in the tree
	Modifications:	changed τὴν -> det English from "with the" to "the"

	Deletion:	410030040071	ποιῆσαι
	Comment: It seems more like the merging of "ἀγαθὸν" (good) and "ποιῆσαι" (to do) to become "ἀγαθοποιῆσαι" (to do good)
	Comment: So it should be:
	Deletion:	410030040071	ἀγαθὸν
	Substitution:	410030040081	410030040071	ποιῆσαι	ἀγαθοποιῆσαι	"to do good" -> verb
	Modifications:	deleted [ἀγαθὸν -> adj -> adjp -> np -> O ->] CL
	Modifications:	changed ποιῆσαι -> verb Unicode to "ἀγαθοποιῆσαι", Lemma to "ἀγαθοποιέω", StrongNumber to 15, morphId to 410030040071, English to "to do good",

	Addition:	410030050191	σου	"of you" -> pron
	Modifications:	created [σου. -> pron -> np(0) -> np(1) -> np(2)], inserted np(2) between np(3) and np(4) where "χεῖρα" -> np(4)
	Modifications:	changed σου -> pron Unicode to "σου.", English to "of you.", morphId to 410030050191, Lemma to "σύ"
	Modifications:	changed "τὴν" -> det English from "the (your)" to "the"
	Modifications:	changed "χεῖρα" -> noun English from "hand." to "hand"
	Comment: I followed the structure of "the hand of him" later in the verse, but I wonder if it is not better to think of it as "the hand" -> np and "of yours" -> as sisters.
	Comment: So it is more like [the hand][of you] rather than [the [[hand] [of you]]]

	Substitution:	410030320181	410030320181	αἱ	ζητοῦσίν
	Comment: Above diff analysis is incorrect. It is the deletion of "καὶ αἱ ἀδελφαί σου"
	Modifications:	deleted [καὶ -> conj ->] np(0), deleted ["καὶ αἱ ἀδελφαί σου" --> np ->] np(0)
	Modifications:	changed "ἔξω" -> adv morphId to 410030320171, "ζητοῦσίν" -> verb morphId to 410030320181, "σε" -> pron morphId to 410030320191


41004001
	Addition:	410040010171	τὸ	"the" -> det
	Modifications:	created [τὸ -> det -> np(0)], inserted np(0) between pp and np(1) where "πλοῖον" --> np(1)
	Modifications:	changed πλοῖον -> noun English from "a boat" to "boat"
41004008
	Substitution:	410040080171	410040080171	ἓν	εἰς	-> prep
	Comment: Because "ἓν" is adj and "εἰς" is prep, I think it is more like deleting "ἓν" and adding "εἰς"
	Comment: Being a prep, it probably combines with following np to form a pp
	Comment: There is no {pp -> CL} rule, no {pp CL -> CL} rule, So I think is a pp -> ADV since there is a {pp -> ADV} rule
	Comment: Automatic update of the tree has changed the other "ἓν" into prep as well.
	Comment: Automatic update of the tree has changed [num -> nump] -> np to [noun] -> np
	Comment: So I think these two phrases are also {pp -> ADV}
	Comment: Not sure if it is a conjunction of three pp's or three ADV's, and if ADV's, are they separate or further conjoined into one ADV
	Comment: To follow the original tree as close as possible, I will make them into {ADV conj ADV conj ADV -> ADV(0)} and make ADV(0) a sister to V
	Modifications:	deleted ἔφερεν -> verb -> vp -> V -> CL(0) [-> CL(1) ->] CL(2), connected CL(2) to CL(0)
	Modifications:	deleted τριάκοντα -> noun -> np(0) [-> O ->] CL(3)
	Modifications:	changed [ἓν 410040080171 -> prep -> adjp -> np -> S -> CL(3) -> CL(4)] to [εἰς -> prep -> pp(0) -> ADV(0) -> ADV(1)]
	Modifications:	connected pp(0) to np(0), connected CL(0) to ADV(1)
	Modifications:	made similar changes to form the other two pp's and corresponding ADV's, connected ADV(1) to the other two ADV's

	Addition:	410040160041	ὁμοίως	"likewise" -> adv
	Modifications:	created [ὁμοίως -> adv -> advp -> ADV ->] CL, creating VC ADV S P -> CL
	Comment: 410040160051 οἱ changed from det to pron, and there is no {pron CL -> np} rule so must add an np above pron
	Modifications:	changed [οἱ -> pron -> np(0)] to [οἱ -> pron -> np -> np(0)]
	Q: Should "ὁμοίως" be put before VC and up a level so it is more like "and likewise..." using the {advp CL -> CL} rule?
	Comment: The word order has the "οὗτοί" 410040160021 all the way back after "σπειρόμενοι" 410040160091, which seems a bit drastic and unnecessary
	Comment: I think a better alternative is to have "οὗτοί" --> S, "εἰσιν" --> VC, and P is the current S, and the CL spanning the rest of the verse is a relative clause using the {np CL -> np} rule or a conjoined CL
	Q: Do Greek relative clauses have a "gap" in them or are they related by pronominal reference to the np it modifies?
	Comment: The original tree has the former and the later, but in this verse, it is the non-gap CL is marked as a relative clause

41005022
	Addition:	410050220021	ἰδοὺ,	"behold," -> interjection (verb)
	Comment: The biblehub.com website has this as a verb, UGNT morphology has it as an interjection
	Comment: There are several rules with intj, {intj -> vp}, {intj -> V}, {intj -> np}, {intj -> CL}, and {intj np -> np}
	Comment: I looked at the trees in Mat and found if it is "yes", then it is ptcl -> intj -> CL, and if it is "Hosanna", then it is ptcl -> intj -> np -> S
	Comment: I looked at the trees in Mrk and found if it is "Hosanna", it is sometimes to intj -> CL and sometimes to intj -> np -> S, so not consistent, others are intj -> CL and one time to intj np -> np
	Comment: If it is a verb, then I think something like "one of the synagogue leaders by the name of Jairus [came to see]" would be a good tree
	Modifications:	created [ἰδοὺ -> intj -> CL(0) -> CL(1)], inserted CL(1) between CL(2) and CL(3) where CL(2) spans the rest of the verse and CL(3) is the left child of CL(2)

	Deletion:	410050270021	περὶ
	Comment: The diff analysis is incorrect. It is a simple addition of τὰ 410050270021
	Comment: Starting tree already has τὰ but I think it is because of the incorrect diff analysis. out of word order as conjoined to Jesus. I think this analysis is wrong since τὰ is neuter where as Jesus is masculine so gender does not agree, also the τοῦ det is still there
	Addition:	410050270021	τὰ	"that" -> pron
	Comment: UGNT has τὰ as a pron but biblehub.com has it as a det
	Comment: Since UGNT has τὰ as neuter, I think it is intended to be something like "having heard that [the news]"
	Modifications:	created [τὰ -> pron -> np -> O ->] CL, creating V O ADV -> CL
	Q: Should the pp be a modifier of the "that" np using the rule {np pp -> np} rather than as an ADV?

	Comment: Again, ὅτι seems like a complementizer (subordinating marker) and so it seems what is said should be the argument to V and not a sister to "having heard these things, Herod said..."

	Comment: "ἦν γὰρ ὁ ἄνεμος ἐναντίος αὐτοῖς" --> CL seems like it belongs under the previous adjunct CL as an ADV rather than a sister of it since it explains why they were straining.
	Q: For UGNT punctuations, what is the difference between comma and semicolon? Is the semicolon a strong pause/stop than the comma, more like a period than a comma separating two related sentences, as it is for English?
	Comment: "αὐτοὺς" 410060480031 is accusative but it is the subject of "βασανιζομένους", yet "βασανιζομένους" is passive. I would think "αὐτοὺς" would be the object of "ἰδὼν" so that "straining in the rowing" --> CL is a modifier of "them"

	Comment: The following word ἀλάλους in NA28 is an adj (biblehub.com also) but in UGNT it is a noun so that part of the tree has already been fixed
	Comment: Both "κωφοὺς" and "ἀλάλους" are accusative case, which suggest it is the object of "ποιεῖ". I think "ποιεῖ" takes an O and a CL (much like English "want him to go")

	Comment: Normally, I would think of coordinating conjunctions as {X conj X -> X} but the "καὶ" at the beginning of the verse is also coordinating but it is not connected to Verse.
	Comment: But if the first topmost CL is what is coordinated to the last CL of the previous verse, then I think "δὲ" should be connected to the first topmost CL, but the second topmost CL was not connected to it.

	Comment: For "γὰρ" it is coordinating conjunction but it is an adjunct in the tree, but it is also has the meaning of "for" which suggests subordinating.
	Comment: I decided to make this one CL conj CL -> CL as it is with conj 410100140061

	Modifications:	changed "ἑαυτούς" -> pron Unicode to "αὐτόν", Lemma to "αὐτός", StrongNumber to 846, 
	Comment: "αὐτόν" is 3rd person singular so the English should be "him" but the original had "themselves" since the NA28 word is a reflexive yet it was also singular (himself).
	Q: But "λέγοντες" has (they) as a subject, so is that why it is "themselves" originally?
	Q: Should we change the English for "αὐτόν" to "him" be more literal or use what is in most translations?
	Comment: I think I will change it to "him", meaning they actually asked Jesus.
	Modifications: changed ἑαυτούς -> pron English to "him"
	Comment: Should it be "πρὸς αὐτόν" --> IO instead of "πρὸς αὐτόν" --> ADV, though I think if it is IO, then the case should be dative instead of accuasative

	Modifications:	connected np(0) to conj and np(2) where {prep(0) np(2) -> pp(0)}
	Comment: It seems that most often, the "of" for the genitive case goes with the gloss for the det or noun. 
	Comment: But in this verse, we see "of" go with noun in one case and prep in another case.
	Comment: Should we try to make it consistent? Or is it not important what the English gloss is?
	Comment: I think I will make this consistent with putting "of" as part of the gloss of genitive det/nouns

	Q: Is there a different intended analysis by having "ταῦτα" moved to after "παρακολουθήσει"? Maybe something like "will acompany these the ones having believed" and not "these signs"?
	Comment: The original analysis is still correct because "ταῦτα" is neuter but "τοῖς" is masculine.
	Comment: So I will keep the tree the same and just update morphIds

	Comment: np(0) is combined with "ζύμης" --> np(1) to form "leaven of the Pharisees"
	Comment: But the np and CL are not sisters so some links will need to be broken in order to swap places in the tree
	Modifications:	deleted "τῶν Φαρισαίων" --> np(0) [-> np(2) ->] np(3), connected np(3) to np(4) where {np(4) np(0) -> np(2)}
	Modifications:	created [np(5)], connected np(4) to np(5), connected np(5) to np(1) and np(0)
	Comment: The punctuation suggests that "τῶν Φαρισαίων" -> np(0) may be parenthetical and not really adjunct to np(1)
	Comment: But it may be that the grammar allows parenthetical comments to be adjuncts, in which case I think it should be outside of the det, i.e., "τῆς ζύμης" -> np(6), {np(6) np(0) -> np}
	Comment: Also, the non-restrictive relative clause is inside of the det.

	Comment: It is more like moving "ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ" --> pp to between "σημεῖα" --> np(0) and "μεγάλα" --> np(1)
	Comment: "μεγάλα" changed from adj to noun
	Comment: But np(0) and np(1) are both neuter so I think they should be be kept together, so np(1) will not be in word order in the tree

	Comment: "οἱ" changed from det to pron
	Modifications:	created [np(1)], inserted np(1) between np(2) and pron, where {pron CL -> np(2)}
	Q: Why is not "πάντες" -> np(0) and "οἱ" -> np(1) first combined to np(2) and then combined with the following CL/np since that seems to modify "all the ones"?

	ERROR: The NA28 tree has a problem. It has {np -> np -> np -> np -> CL -> CL}!
	Comment: FIX NA28 TREE?
	Comment: With the conj deleted, it seems "βουλευτὴς" should/could return to being in the word order before ὑπάρχων since we don't need to coordinate two np's
	Comment: The analysis of the VC can remain, though it seems the verb is not the typical copula verb so maybe it could be a V O -> CL -> np
	Comment: Not sure if it should be "βουλευτὴς ὑπάρχων" --> CL that can be either a relative clause or CL -> np and be an np adjunct.
	Comment: Or whether it should be "ὑπάρχων, ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος" --> CL as the relative clause (or adjp) to "βουλευτὴς" --> np
	Q: Why is does NA28 have "βουλευτὴς ὑπάρχων καὶ ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος" --> CL -> adj rather than just let CL be a relative clause?
	Comment: Based upon the UGNT punctuations, I think I'm going to treat it as a non-restrictive relative clause followed by an adjunct np

	Comment: This is another situation where it would be nice to have a VP node since the conj seems to be coordinating "met him" and "reported..." where they have the same subject and verbs have the same tense
	Comment: Since there is no VP node, we would need to go from V O -> CL, remove the ADV so we have CL at the top and coordinate the two CL
	Comment: Besides the coordination issue, I'm wondering if the CL spanning "λέγοντες, ὅτι ὁ παῖς αὐτοῦ ζῇ." should still be CL -> ADV and the ADV is the adjunct to "reported" --> V
	Q: Or now with the new conj, is it a conjoined CL to the a higher level CL rather than being an ADV?

	Comment: The English gloss for "οὐχ" (not) includes the verb gloss "find" I guess since the verb is future tense, but in English the negation is between "will" and "find", rather than "not will find"

	Modifications:	changed [Ὡς -> adv] -> CL to [Ὡς -> adv -> advp] -> CL
	Comment: It seems that the first CL is an ADV to the second CL rather than CL CL, so should CL go to ADV and ADV is sister to "he stood up" --> V?

	Comment: Therefore the substitution above is not a real substitution.
	Comment: Normally the verb "εἰμί" (1510) is a copula verb (i.e. VC) that takes a predicate (P) as an argument

	Comment: Not sure how to gloss ἢ, it would make more sense if it was outside/before of "πρὶν" but I didn't see an example of this anywhere else in Acts
	Comment: In Mat1:18, Mrk14:30, Luk2:26, Act7:2, and Act25:16 there is an identical sequence "πρὶν ἢ"and no gloss for ἢ

	Comment: It is more like "τῇ οὔσῃ ἐν Κορίνθῳ" --> np(0) with "ἡγιασμένοις ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ" --> np(1) switched order
	Comment: But this seems to make np(0) a modifier of np(1) rather than np(0) the modifier of np(2) ogiginally before it since np(2) and np(1) are semantically parallel (i.e. to the church and two the ones)	
	Modifications:	deleted "τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ," --> np(2) [->] np(3) [->] np(4), connected np(4) to np(2)
	Modifications:	inserted np(3) between np(4) and np(1)
	Comment: But this "new" analysis seems inconsistent with the grammar since np(2) and np(0) is feminine, but np(1) is masculine.
	Comment: It may be better to keep the original tree for grammatical reasons though it means keeping with the original word order.

	Modifications:	changed [Ἴδε -> verb -> vp ->] V -> CL to [ἴδε -> intj ->] V -> CL

	Comment: Because the phrase "ἀλήθειαν λέγω" and "οὐ ψεύδομαι," are moved to the end of the verse, there are several places where "ἐν Χριστῷ" --> pp can attach.
	Comment: It can attach to the np "κῆρυξ καὶ ἀπόστολος" or just to "ἀπόστολος", or serve as an ADV as in "I speak the truth in Christ, I don't lie"
	Comment: I think it maybe is just to "ἀπόστολος" since the "I speak the truth" part is in between these

	Deletion:	620040120181	ἡμῖν
	Comment: It is more like "ἐν ἡμῖν" --> ADV and "τετελειωμένη" --> vp switched places
	Comment: But this breaks up the constituent {"τετελειωμένη ἐστίν" --> vp -> V}
	Comment: I think the "ἐστιν." --> VC can move up to a new higher CL where the lower CL is the S, and make the lover {V ADV -> CL} be a P
	Comment: I think this analysis is supported by the different morphology of the two verbs and also why the ADV is moved in between them.

	Comment: It is more like "δέ" is moved to after "ἐστιν", but that moves it out of its traditional second position of the clause "τίς ἐστιν δέ ὁ νικῶν τὸν κόσμον," --> CL
	Comment: I will keep the tree the same since it still makes the most sense.

	Deletion:	630010050101	σοι
	Comment: It is more like moving "καινὴν" after "ἐντολὴν" to make it consistent with the tree since they form one constituent in the tree, "ἐντολὴν καινὴν" --> np
	Comment: But "γράφων σοι" is still before "οὐχ ὡς ἐντολὴν καινὴν" in the tree since it is at a higher level and shouldn't break the constituent "οὐχ ὡς ἐντολὴν καινὴν, ἀλλὰ ἣν εἴχαμεν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς," --> CL since there is a conjunction keeping the two internal CL's conjoined
	Comment: So even with these changes, I think it is best to leave the tree as it is and just change morphIds

	Comment: In 1Co6:16, NA28 has it as num, UGNT has it as noun, but the verse was not flagged as having a substitution.
	Comment: The result is the "new" UGNT tree has the lexical node as noun, but the parent is still nump, which is incorrect.
	Comment: My guess is there could be many more of these, but I guess they will be flagged when a rule is not found.

	Comment: Not sure how to incorporate the added verb "δεῖ". If the voice was passive (to be physically bound or bound by law), then it would be clearer.
	Comment: Searching for "δεῖ" in NA28, found similar situations (in 1Co8:2, 1Co11:19, 1Co15:25 1Th4:1, 1Tm3:2)
	Comment: "δεῖ" is glossed as "it is necessary (for)" and the structure is V S -> CL(0) where CL -> np -> S -> CL(0)
	Comment: It is found in John (e.g., 3:7, 3:30, 4:20, 9:24, 10:16, 12:34, 20:9), and it is the same situation as the above.
	Comment: It also shows up in Rev (e.g., 4:1, 10:11, 11:5, 17:10, 20:3, 22:6) and glossed as "must" or "ought"
	Comment: In Rev, the tree structure basically the same but it is more often V is after S. 11:5 has the conditional before it and it is glossed as "ought"
	Comment: I gloss it as "it is necessary" since that occurs often in John and John wrote Rev and it makes more sense here.

	Comment: Now that there is a separate "the" for "authority", I think the first {τὴν -> det(1)} should be moved down for just "δύναμιν" --> np(4)

	Substitution:	660180020271	660180020261	φυλακὴ	μεμισημένου
	Comment: The diff analysis is missing the deletion of "καὶ φυλακὴ παντὸς θηρίου ἀκαθάρτου" at the end, and substitution is incorrect
	Comment: It should be:
	Deletion:	660180020081	ἔπεσεν

	Deletion:	660180020271	φυλακὴ

	Modifications:	deleted [καὶ -> conj(0) ->] -> np -> P -> CL -> CL(1)
	Modifications:	deleted ["φυλακὴ παντὸς θηρίου ἀκαθάρτου" --> np]
	Comment: I think the final "μεμισημένου" --> CL should not be an adjp but be conjoined higher up with the other CL's with "has fallen", "has become"
	Modifications:	deleted μεμισημένου -> verb -> vp -> V -> CL(2) [-> adjp]
	Modifications:	changed καὶ 660180020311 -> conj(1) morphId to 660180020251
	Modifications:	changed μεμισημένου -> verb morphId to 660180020261
	Modifications:	connected CL(1) to conj(1) and CL(2)
	Comment: With the punctuation, I think the revised tree seems consistent.
	Comment: However, now that the verb "ἔπεσεν" is deleted, I wonder if "Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη!" --> isn't the subject of "ἔπεσεν" --> V rather than adjoining two CL's.

	Comment: The diff is incorrect.
	Comment: It is more like "τοῦ θεοῦ" --> np and "εἰσιν" --> VC switched order
	Comment: However, the tree needs to remain the same so "τοῦ θεοῦ" --> np can remain as an adjunct with "λόγοι ἀληθινοὶ" --> np

	Substitution:	660220080051	660220080061	καὶ	καὶ
