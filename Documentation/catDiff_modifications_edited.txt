	Comment: Since the tree is not a pure syntactic tree (i.e., words are moved around) but tries to reflect the semantic meaning.
	Comment: I think the last CL "μακροθυμεῖ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς?", along with the conj, should be inside of "μὴ" rather than only the previous CL being inside of "μὴ" (i.e. "will he not have patience with them?
	Comment: The English gloss of "δὲ" has the [will not] so it is outide the following clauses, but that is not represented in the tree.
	Comment: Or if we don't want to change the in this way, then maybe just moving "μὴ" to before "οὐ" would achieve this effect, but I personally don't like changing word order if not necessary.

480040190061	prep	conj (subordinating)
	Comment: There is no rule {conj np -> pp} but we do have a rule that is {conj -> prep} so we can just add a prep above the conj
	Comment: But doing this seems to negate why UGNT has it as a conj rather than a prep.
	Q: Would it be better to make it {CL -> ADV} and have {conj CL -> CL}?
	Comment: I think it is best to use it as a conj if it makes sense, and I think it does in this situation.
	Modifications:	deleted "οὗ μορφωθῇ Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν—" --> CL(0) [-> np -> pp] -> ADV
	Modifications:	created [CL(1)], connected ADV to CL(1), connected CL(1) to conj and CL(0)

	Comment: This seems similar to 460040080101, and for that situation (though this time there is a parallel clause following this one), and I chose to utilize {ptcl -> conj}

	Comment: There is not a {verb -> adjp}, only {verb -> vp} and {verb -> intj}
	Comment: It seems making this into a relative clause matches how it is translated in NIV
	Comment: In 1Jn5:10, there is a similar construction at the beginning of the verse, and so the pp of belief should be ADV, and "through him" should also be ADV
	Comment: There is also a det to pron change 600010210011 that is not listed here.
	Comment: There is a {pron np -> np} rule so no need to fix the tree for this change,
	Comment: but given the analysis that we now have a relative clause we should add an np above pron
	Modifications:	changed τοὺς -> [pron -> np(0)] -> Verse to τοὺς -> [pron -> np(1) -> np(0)] -> Verse, English to "the [ones]"	Modifications:	changed "δι’ αὐτοῦ" --> [pp -> np(0) -> np(1)] to

	Comment: The starting tree is completely blank except for Verse node as a parent of an empty node! The NA28 tree is complete.
	Comment: What happened here? Are there other verses that are like this?
	Comment: Rather than creating the whole verse by hand, I will copy and paste the part of the tree from NA28 that is under S/Verse
	Comment: There is no {adj -> np} rule, but there is a {np adjp -> np} rule so just need to replace the np node with an adjp node above adj
