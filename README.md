**UGNT Trees**

**Copyright © 2022 by Cherith Analytics**

The UGNT Trees are based upon the unfoldingWord® Greek New Testament (UGNT) text and morphology, version 0.27. The original work by unfoldingWord is available from [git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/el-x-koine_ugnt](https://git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/el-x-koine_ugnt). [unfoldingword.org/ugnt](https://www.unfoldingword.org/ugnt).

References on UGNT are available from unfoldingWord at [unfoldingword.org/ugnt](https://www.unfoldingword.org/ugnt).

The morphological data (text, lemma, UGNT Strong's number, analysis) in the UGNT Trees comes directly from the unfoldingWord data, and so any issues with this data is the sole responsibility of unfoldingWord.  Cherith Analytics modified the data in a few places, which are documented in the Documentation folder, and so any issues with the modifications are the sole responsibility of Cherith Analytics.

The UGNT Trees are also heavily based on multiple Greek New Testament trees developed by [Global Bible Initiative, LLC](https://www.gbi.llc) for internal use. Issues related to syntax or other data in the UGNT Trees are the sole responsibility of Cherith Analytics and will be fixed in future releases.

Below is the description of the repository contents:

**Documentation/** - folder with the documentation
  * **Modifications-to-UGNT-Morphology.md** - lists the modifications that were made to a copy of unfoldingWord's UGNT morphology that was used to develop the UGNT Trees
  * **ugnt.glosses.tsv** - Cherith Glosses for the Greek New Testament are glosses that show the meaning of each word in the whole UGNT text in its specific context. They are created to help people who do not know Greek to understand the text. The glosses are in English only. They are compiled by consulting all the major English translations and selecting the most common term in each case. It is therefore a "majority gloss" where alternative meanings are not included.
