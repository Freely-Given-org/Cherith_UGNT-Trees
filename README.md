# UGNT-Trees
The trees are based upon the unfoldingWordÂ® Greek New Testament (UGNT) text and morphology, version 0.27. The original work by unfoldingWord is available from [unfoldingword.org/ugnt](https://www.unfoldingword.org/ugnt).

[References on UGNT](https://www.unfoldingword.org/for-translators/content#UGNT) are available from unfoldingWord.

The morphological data (text, lemma, UGNT Strong's number, analysis) in the trees comes directly from the unfoldingWord data, and so any issues with this data is the sole responsibility of unfoldingWord.  Cherith Analytics modified the data in a few places, which are documented in the Documentation folder, and so any issues with the modifications are the sole responsibility of Cherith Analytics.

Issues related to syntax or other data in the trees are the sole responsibility of Cherith Analytics and will be fixed in future releases.
