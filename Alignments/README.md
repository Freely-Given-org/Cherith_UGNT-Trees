**UGNT Alignments**

**Copyright © 2023 by Cherith Analytics**

The UGNT Alignments are based upon the unfoldingWord® Greek New Testament (UGNT) text and morphology, version 0.27. The original work by unfoldingWord is available from [git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/el-x-koine_ugnt](https://git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/el-x-koine_ugnt). [unfoldingword.org/ugnt](https://www.unfoldingword.org/ugnt).

References on UGNT are available from unfoldingWord at [unfoldingword.org/ugnt](https://www.unfoldingword.org/ugnt).

The morphological data (text, lemma, UGNT Strong's number, analysis) in the UGNT Alignments comes directly from the unfoldingWord data, and so any issues with this data is the sole responsibility of unfoldingWord.  Cherith Analytics modified the data in a few places, which are documented in the Documentation folder, and so any issues with the modifications are the sole responsibility of Cherith Analytics.

The UGNT Alignments are also heavily based on multiple Greek New Testament alignments developed by [Global Bible Initiative, LLC](https://www.gbi.llc) for internal use. Issues related to syntax or other data in the UGNT Trees are the sole responsibility of Cherith Analytics and will be fixed in future releases.
